    description: 'PANIC is a lightweight yet powerful open source monitoring and alerting solution for Cosmos and Substrate based nodes by Simply VC.'
    + 'The tool was built with user friendliness in mind, without excluding cool and useful features like phone calls for critical alerts '
    + "and Telegram commands for increased control over your alerter. The alerter's focus on a modular design means that it is beginner "
    + 'friendly but also developer friendly. It allows the user to decide which components of the alerter to set up while making it easy '
    + 'for developers to add new features. PANIC also offers two levels of configurability, user and internal, allowing more experienced '
    + 'users to fine-tune the alerter to their preference. We are sure that PANIC will be beneficial for node operators in the Blockchain community '
    + 'and we look forward for feedback. Feel free to read on if you are interested in the design of the alerter, if you wish to try it out, or '
    + 'if you would like to support and contribute to this open source project.',
